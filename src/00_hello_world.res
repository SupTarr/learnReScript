// Hello,
//
// ReScript compiles down to JavaScript. The generated JavaScript is
// readable. You can run it in the browser and also Node.js.
//
// The ReScript compiler generated JavaScript has the file extension
// which ends in `bs.js` to differentiate them from regular JavaScript
// files. The `bs` stands for BuckleScript compiler -- an earlier name
// before being rebranded as the ReScript compiler.
//
// To build this tutorial you can run the following command from the
// root directory.
//
//    $ npm run start
//
// This will build the project in watch mode. Any changes you make to
// this file will be detected and the build will automatically re-run.
//
// ReScript projects are built using `bsb` build system.
//
// You can look inside `package.json` to see that `start` command is an
// alias for building this project: `bsb -make-world -w`.
//
// The build failed because the code below has a syntax error. Read the
// error message and fix the code below. After you save your changes to
// file the build will re-run automatically.
//
// The build has succeeded when there are no errors remaining. You can
// look at `tour.bs.js` to see that the generated JavaScript code is:
//
//    console.log("Hello, World!");
//
Js.log("Hello, World!)
